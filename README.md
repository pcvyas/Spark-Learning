# Spark-Learning
Fooling around with Spark and Scala during my last internship, followed an online tutorial that showed me how to do basic data manipulation with Spark

VERY easy to get this up and running. 
You'll need to download a version of Spark that's been prebuilt with Hadoop 2.4 or later.You can do this by visiting the following link:

http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html

It comes with Scala runtime packages, so you don't need to worry about having Scala installed separately. However, you'll need sbt:

http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Setup.html

Just remember to modify build.sbt with the correct Spark and Scala versions. To run the program, simply type "sbt run" in the project base directory.
